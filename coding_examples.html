                                    <p>For part of the task I had to make a dropdown list that could only appear at certain screen sizes 
                                        and would only reveal itself when hovered over by the mouse. 
                                        The code above is written in CSS and shows how the dropdown list and it's list items should behave.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The dropdown contained 6 seperate list's with 5 to 6 items in each list so  instead of targetting the items individually,
                                        I made my selector's target their positions conceptually. The First/ Last &amp; nth child selectors will search for the items
                                        based on their postion relative to their parent container. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Using this technique came in very handy because if I ever needed to repeat the process all I would have to do was give another list
                                        the dropdown class.

                                    <p>For part of the course we had to learn about the query language SQL and after covering a large amount of it's syntax we
                                        were then given the challenge to create a fairly complex query for one of four different databases. I chose the movie database 
                                        for my example because aside from being a fan of movies myself it was a good oppourtunity to try out some interesting syntax.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The Objective of this query is to find the highest rated film and when the film was released along with it's director
                                        and lead actor.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>This query does a few different things at once so i will explain the finer points.
                                        The SELECT portion of the query is the part that will display all of the different columns to the user upon request.
                                        The first part of the query collects a list of movies from the database and then displays it's lead actor and director, Then it 
                                        displays the films genre and year of release followed by it's overall rating.  
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The FROM part of the query collects all the different pieces of information from the individual tables attached to the database
                                        and saves the different table names for ease of use. The FROM section also contains a simple subquery that makes sure that 
                                        the query only displays a single row of information per film for readability. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Finally the WHERE section of the query is what links all the different tables together by linking primary keys to foreign keys
                                       which are shown by the equality operators. At the end of the query is my ORDER BY request that organizes the whole query by the 
                                       highest rated movies. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Upon tetsting you may notice that the film "Trainspotting" has no actualy rating, this is due to the database not holding
                                        the information. At first I tried to make the query fill this box but after some difficulties i decided it would be best 
                                        to leave the box blank. If this was a real request for an actual website then I would use javascript to fill any empty box
                                        with the term "N/A" as this would prove a lot easier then trying to work SQL for the feature.
                                    </p>

                                        it into the "SQL Practice Editor" near the bottom of the linked page.
